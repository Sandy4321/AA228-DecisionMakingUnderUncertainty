AA228-DecisionMakingUnderUncertainty
======================
Fall 2016 - class @ Stanford. Structure Learning, Markov Decision Process, Reinforcement Learning. Taught by Mykel Kochenderfer.

## Project 1 - Structure Learning
Three dataset of various size were made available. A Bayesian Score function has been coded and compared to the already implemented one. This function is used as a metric to judge the performance of the algorithms. A K2 and a local search algorithm have been implemented as well. The K2 has been used to generate an initial structure and the local search to refine this structure. 

## Project 2 - MDPs / Reinforcement Learning 

## Final Project - Managing groundwater under uncertain seasonal recharge
Final project done in collaboration
